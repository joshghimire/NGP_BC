%% ----------------------- REVIEW: TYPES OF VARIABLES -----------------------

% Some variables are not numbers! For example, experimental groups or
% biological sex could be stored in an array of letters or words

% Below is some example data and code to work with different variable types
%%
Experimental_group = ['a'; 'a'; 'b'; 'b']
Results = [100; 98; 34; 29]

% If we want to find the results for those in experimental group a,
% first we will find where the 'a' subjects are

Group_a = find(Experimental_group == 'a')

% then we use those locations to index into the Results variable, figuring
% out specifically the results for those assigned group a.

Group_a_results = Results(Group_a)

% You can also do the above two things in one line, like this:

Group_a_results = Results(Experimental_group == 'a')

% there are generally many different ways to approach a problem in Matlab.

%% ----------------------- PROBLEM SET #2 INTRODUCTION -----------------------
% Import problem_set_2_data

% You can drag the .mat file into your Workspace
% You can also use the 'load' function (type 'help load' below to see how
% to use that function)

% Here is an explanation of the data for this problem set:

    % It contains three vectors, each of which contains data for a
    % different property of each
        % Biological sex (M/F) –  strings ‘m’ or ‘f’
        % Mass (g)
        % Tail length (mm)

%% ----------------------- PROBLEM SET #2.1 -----------------------
% Analyses:

% Calculate average tail length
% Calculate average mass by sex

%% space to work on analyses





%% ----------------------- REVIEW: PLOTTING DATA -----------------------

% Here is some sample data to plot
Group_1 = [2 4 7 2 4 8]
Group_2 = [3 8 7 9 4 7]

%here we take the means of those group, saving them in a new array
Means_to_plot = [mean(Group_1) mean(Group_2)]

% Make a bar plot with those means
figure;
bar(Means_to_plot)

% We should add information to help the viewer interpret the figure
figure;
bar(Means_to_plot)
set(gca,'XTickLabel',{'Group 1','Group 2'})
ylabel('Amount')
title('Difference between groups')

% you can also do things like change the colors or thickness of the bars.

%% ----------------------- PROBLEM SET #2.2 -----------------------
% Analyses:

% Make a plot to visualize relationship between tail length and mass
%   -Think: what is the best plot for this?

% Visualize sex differences in mass
%   -Think: what is the best plot for this?

%% space to work on analyses







%% ----------------------- INTRO: STATISTICS -----------------------

% Statistics can be done in Matlab
% We can run a ttest on the groups we created earlier

% Here we use the function, ttest2, to check whether the difference in
% the example groups from before is statistically significant
[h,p]  = ttest2(Group_1,Group_2)

%this function outputs:
    % h, which is whether the null-hypothesis was rejected
    % p, which is the p value

% More on Matlab t-tests here:
% https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/ttest2.html

%% ----------------------- PROBLEM SET #2.3 ----------------------- 
% Analyses:

% Test to see if the difference in mass by sex is statistically significant

%% space to work on analyses







%% ----------------------- EXTRA PROBLEM (CHALLENGING) ----------------------- 

% Having the p value reflected in the title of the graph could be useful.
% Try to make a plot with th p-value reflected in the title.

% There are functions that can convert numbers-to-strings and 
% strings-to-numbers
